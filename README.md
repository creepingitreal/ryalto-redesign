Design Challenge

Please select one of the options below for your challenge.

We would like you to improve the design of your chosen option. Please create your design in software of your choice, such as Figma or Canva. We’d like to see your new design as a PDF.

Then, please can you take your design and build it in HTML and CSS. We’re not looking for any interactivity, just your static design created in HTML and CSS. We’re looking for clean, semantic HTML and easily maintainable CSS. Vanilla CSS is preferred. Please can you submit this as a zip file.

Please can you accompany your submission with an explanation of your design and details around why you chose to create it the way that you did. This could be annotations on the drawing, or a supporting document.

Questions

Please can you include answers to the following questions with your design submission. We're looking for you to show your knowledge and your writing style.

Please do not use any generative AIs to create your answers, we’re looking to get to know you, not an LLM!
